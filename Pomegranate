          <p>
            We are a group of people with decades of experience in growing and
            selling pomegranate. We know what a good pomegranate looks like and how they
            are grown. A pomegranate is a sweet, tart fruit with thick, red skin. While the skin is not edible, it holds hundreds of juicy seeds that you can eat plain or sprinkle on salads, oatmeal, hummus, and other dishes.
